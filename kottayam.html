            On the outskirts of Kottayam lies a hill station of rocky terrains sought after for its pristine nature. On one side of the main rock are extremely tall and steep rocks and on the other is a valley of fearful depth. Bordering this crude landscape like a silver lace is the Meenachil River. 
            During the months of December/January the landscape comes alive in a riot of colours with orchids and wild flowers.
