        <div class="px-3 py-3">
        <p>The hills, rivers and grassland, all come together to enshrine the magnificent Banasura Sagar Dam in Wayanad. 
            One has no option but to be in awe of the largest earthen dam in India and the second largest in Asia. 
            But it isnâ€™t just statistics that add to its mysticism. The surroundings are pristine with a cool breeze opening up a valley full of gigantic slopes, crystal clear waters, a wildlife sanctuary and a plethora of flowering plants. It is among the most popular picnic locations in the district along with its multitude of boating options. 
            Our trekking aficionados can find more than few hidden trails that lead to spots with exquisite visuals of the surrounding valley.</p>

        <p>
            Tholpetty Wildlife Sanctuary or Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary is a beautiful destination located 20 km east of Mananthavady on the Kodagu Road. 
            The jeep ride here offers brilliant opportunities to view various animal and bird species in their natural habitat. 
            One gets to see herds of elephants, guars, deer, monkeys, tigers, leopards, bears and many species of reptiles, fishes, butterflies and birds including vultures. Visitors are restricted to the outer tourist zone. It gives one an excellent perspective on how we must strive to conserve these natural wonders.

            <h3>Sentinel Rock waterfalls</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="px-3 py-3">
        <p>
            The dense forest around you is increasingly vibrating, the birds flutter in anticipation and the steep, shaky path around you is slowly elevating you to a vantage point where they say you're going to encounter a sight only a few have truly witnessed. Your journey ends and a white stream is seen falling headfirst into sharp granite rocks that welcome it as old friends. This is Sentinel Rock or Soochipara Waterfalls, on an off-route from Wayanad near Kalpetta, a place where both the trek and visuals are surreal. People drive across tense terrains and walk a naturally rocky pathway to reach the summit. But they never complain about the end result.
         The next time you're near Wayanad, do remember to check out this natural masterpiece on the Kozhikode - Vythiri - Gudallur Highway.
