        <p>Celebrated as the Granary of Kerala, Palakkad is a vast stretch of fertile plains interspersed with hills, rivers, mountain streams and forests. The gateway to Kerala from the north, a 40 kilometre break in the mountains known as the Palakkad Gap gives access to this land situated at the foot of the Western Ghats. The pass acts as a corridor between Kerala and the neighbouring Tamil Nadu and played a key role in the trade relations between the east and west coasts of peninsular India. Deriving its name from the Malayalam words Pala (Alsteriascholaris) and Kadu (forest), this place was once a stunning expanse of forest covered with the sweet-scented flowers of the Pala tree. 
            A potpourri of Tamil and Kerala culture, some of the finest Carnatic musicians hail from this district which continues to be a principally agrarian society.

        </div>
        <div class="px-3 py-3">
        <p>The dam is located en route to Nelliyampathy Hills. A beautifully landscaped, well-maintained dam garden beckons visitors at the entrance. 
            With a plethora of rides and manicured trees and plants, the garden is built to provide happiness to children and elders alike.
            Spanning the garden will take one to the toe of the dam. The steps to the crest of the dam might look strenuous, but it’s worth the effort. A stunning view of Nelliyampathy Hills awaits visitors at the top. Take a stroll along the crest to get a panoramic view of the reservoir in the backdrop of the hills on one side and green paddy fields on the other.
