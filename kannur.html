        <p>Kannur is most renowned for the Theyyam performances in its temples. 
            This magnificent art form plays an integral part in the culture of this Northern Kerala district.
             Formerly known as Cannanore, Marco Polo christened it a ‘Great Emporium Of Spice Trade’.

            Legend has it that it had interactions and trade relations with the rest of the world since the time of King Solomon to the Greeks, Arabs and Romans. It has a plethora of forts, temples, beaches and wildlife sanctuaries that regularly attract visitors. Major festivals and events are held throughout the year and this is among the best places in Kerala to spend your vacation in.

        <p>
            Located around 4 km from Thalassery town, the sprawling bungalow is an excellent example of architectural prowess. 
            With wide verandas, huge doors and windows, it has the features of a typical colonial mansion. 
            River Kuyyali flowing in the area adds to the beauty of the bungalow. Gundert Memorial Church and a cemetery are located near the bungalow.
            As part of the Thalassery Heritage Tourism Project, the iconic structure is being renovated to convert it into a heritage and language museum and German language study centre.

        <div class="px-3 py-3">
        <p>Far ahead, on the horizon, golden glowing embers of the sunset burst into the sky. 
            The gentle ocean waves sing paeans to the setting sun. 
            If you walk further into the sea, along the ancient pier, you may be able to hear the many historic tales it whispers. 
            You are at the Thalassery Kadalpalam, a sea bridge that was built in early 20th century when Thalassery was a busy commercial hub.
            The 500-ft long bridge was built by the British in Kannur district in Kerala, and looks out into the Arabian Sea. It is 24 metres wide on the shore-side and 40 metres wide at the sea end.
