            Affectionately nicknamed the 'Venice of the East' by travellers from across the world, Alappuzha is a district of immense natural beauty. 
            Embraced by the Arabian Sea in the west and a network of lakes, lagoons and freshwater rivers criss-crossing it, this backwater country is home toa vibrant animal and avian life. 
            By virtue of its proximity to the sea, the town has always carved out an exclusive place for itself in the maritime history of Kerala.
Renowned for its boat races, beaches, marine products and coir industry, the singularity of this land is the region called Kuttanad. A land of lush paddy fields referred to as the 'Rice Bowl of Kerala', it is one of the few places in the world where farming is done below sea level. This once prosperous trading and fishing centre is nowadays a world renowned backwater tourist destination.

        </div>
        <div class="px-3 py-3">
        <p>Kuttanad, the 'Rice Bowl of Kerala’, lies at the very heart of the backwaters in Alappuzha district. 
        Its wealth of paddy crops is what got it this unique nickname. Based in the inner regions of the district, it is a huge area of reclaimed land, separated by dikes from water which is higher than it appears. The view of the countryside is what enchants all who pass through this area while travelling via houseboats. It has been speculated that it is perhaps the only place in the world where farming is done up to 2 meters below sea level. 
        The area is serviced by 4 major rivers: Pampa, Meenachil, Achankovil and Manimala.

        <p>
            Pathiramanal is a bird watcher’s paradise. It is about 1.5 km from Muhamma Boat Jetty and about 13 km from Alappuzha. 
            This small island on the backwaters is a safe haven for hundreds of rare migrating birds. A 1.5 hour motor boat ride or a 30 minute speedboat trip from Alappuzha gets you here. Surrounded by the Vembanad Lake, stretching from Alappuzha to Kochi and the Kayamkulam Lake, Pathiramanal is accessible only by boat. 
            It is an ideal pit stop in the middle of a houseboat ride.

        <p>Legend has it that first priestess at the great Mannarasala Sree Nagaraja Temple gave birth to a five headed snake. 
            It is said to guard the premises even today, while residing in the ancestral house. To this day, people throng in great numbers to this temple to avail of its special turmeric powder, rumoured to cure a multitude of rare diseases including leprosy. Women, who are unable to conceive, also seek the temple out for its special blessings. The temple is dedicated to the Serpent God - Nagaraja. 
            It is believed that Nagaraja, as the primary deity, is endowed with the form of Hari (Lord Vishnu) and the spirit of Lord Shiva.
