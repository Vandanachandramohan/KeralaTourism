        <div class="px-3 py-3">
        <p>Thrissur Pooram, often termed as the festival of festivals in Kerala is held in Thrissur, a northern district of Kerala. 
            The word pooram literally means group or meeting. The tradition has that every year the Gods and Goddesses residing at temples in the neighbouring regions come together for a day of celebration at the famous Vadakkumnatha Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva. This coming together is led from the front by Goddess Bhagavati, and Lord Krishna, presiding deities of Paramekkavu and Thiruvambadi temples, located close to the Vadakkumnatha Temple.
             The sprawling Thekkinkadu grounds around the Vadakkumnatha Temple become the rendezvous for gods and goddesses from adjoining temples.
