        One of the premier trade capitals of the Old World, Kollam is the centre of the countryâ€™s cashew trading and processing industry. Extolled by Marco Polo and Ibn Batuta in glowing terms, this was once a famous port of international spice trade. This historic town is home to the celebrated Ashtamudi Lake, making it a gateway to the breath-taking backwaters of Kerala. The eight-hour boat trip between Kollam and Alappuzha is the longest and most enchanting experience on the backwaters of Kerala. The momentous decision to introduce a new Malayalam era was convened at Kollam and hence the Malayalam calendar came to be known as kollavarsham.

        <p>
            A rare entity among the temple architecture of Kerala, cave temples is few and arouse great curiosity. 
            The one at Ittiva at Chadayamangalam in Kollam district is one such temple, virtually carved out from a gigantic piece of rock, lying in the middle of a paddy field. From a distance this architectural wonder gives the impression of a sleeping elephant.
This rock cut temple represents the vibes of an ancient culture and also the traditional artistic excellence prevalent at that time. The temple known as Kottukal Kal Thrikovil Cave Temple has two square rooms with the main deity of Lord Ganapathy in between. 
The other deities include Lord Siva in the form of Siva Lingam, Hanuman and Nandikeswara. A Mandapam (roof) in front of one of the rooms stands testimony to the skill of those who build this temple from a single piece of rock. 
The temple premise also has a well that never dries up.
